<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship exhaust gas scrubber market comprises three main types: open loop, closed loop, and hybrid scrubbers. Open loop scrubbers use seawater to wash exhaust gases, discharging the treated water back into the ocean. Closed loop scrubbers, conversely, utilize a recirculated alkaline solution to neutralize sulfur oxides, thereby minimizing environmental impact. Hybrid scrubbers combine features of both systems, offering flexibility to operate in either mode depending on regulatory requirements and water quality, ensuring compliance with emissions standards.</p></p>
