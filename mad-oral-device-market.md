<p><strong>The MAD Oral Device Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mild to Moderate OSA</li><li>Severe OSA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The MAD (Mandibular Advancement Device) market addresses obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with applications for both mild to moderate and severe cases. In mild to moderate OSA, MADs are often the first-line treatment, as they effectively reposition the jaw to enhance airway patency during sleep, improving patient outcomes. For severe OSA, while continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment, MADs serve as an alternative for patients seeking non-invasive options, particularly those intolerant to CPAP.</p></p>
